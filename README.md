## Abstract
Distraction, is the major cause of road accidents, using Computer Vision and Machine Learning,Pose Estimation we are able to detect drivers attention and distraction. <br>
The system classifies driver behavior into five risk levels and uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for enhanced analysis. Preliminary results show 90% accuracy, suggesting significant potential to improve road safety by alerting drivers or initiating corrective actions.


## Overview

## Model

</p>

- **Mediapipe**: Used for keypoint detection to analyze the driver's state.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Employed for detecting potential distraction objects such as phones.
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: Developed by us, that combine Mediapipe's output with the YOLO bounding box's coordinates, for the classification of the driver's state.

## Retrieval

- **Faiss**: Library used to Retrieval part. Retrieval system returns the embedding images most similar a specified query. The process involves comparing the ground-truth classification (GNN) with the classification obtained through K-nearest neighbors (KNN) during the retrieval process with the K-embeddings.
