# Driver Distraction Detection

This project, developed in collaboration with Stefano Politan√≤ and Vincenzo Macellaro, was undertaken as part of the Computer Vision & Cognitive System exam for our Master's degree. The primary objective of the system is to classify the driver's state into five distinct risk categories, ranging from zero to very high.

## Feature: 
1. **Mediapipe**: Used for keypoint detection to analyze the driver's state.
2. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Employed for detecting potential distraction objects such as phones.
3. **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: Developed by us, that combine Mediapipe's output with the YOLO bounding box's coordinates, for the classification of the driver's state.
4. **Faiss**: Library used to Retrieval part. Retrieval system returns the embedding images most similar a specified query. The process involves comparing the ground-truth classification (GNN) with the classification obtained through K-nearest neighbors (KNN) during the retrieval process with the K-embeddings.
